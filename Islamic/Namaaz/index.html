        <h1>HOW TO PRAY SALAH ACCORDING TO QURAN AND SUNNAH OF PROPHET MUHAMMAD.</h1>
        <p><i>Assalamualaikum, we put together this easy to follow step by step guide for Muslim’s looking to learn how to properly perform salah (prayer) according to Qur’an and Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ). This article will not simply just list the steps, but rather will give you a detailed and comprehensive guide to learning ALL about salat.</i></p>
        <img src="https://myislam.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/How-To-Pray-Salah.jpg">
        <p>The five pillars of Islam form the foundation for which a Muslim’s routine and life should be based around. The second pillar is prayer, in Arabic صلاة pronounced as Salah or Salat.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="intro">
        <h2>An Introduction to Salah:</h2>
       <p>*Salah is not intended to just be a mandatory enactment. Rather it is the first and a continuing sign of the believer’s obedience to Allah subhanahu wa ta’ala. </p> 
        <p>*It is a spiritual ritual, a source for gaining strength and patience and as a means of self purification. A believer does not see salah as a burden but rather a privilege to learn and develop a deeper connection to his creator. A Muslim offers prayer out of humility and love to show their inner devotion to Allah because he or she depends on him.</p>
</div>
<div class="types">
<h2>Different Types of Salah:</h2>
<h3>There are four different types of Salah which make up the five daily prayers.</h3>

<ul>
    <li><u>Fardh </u>– Imperative (missing a fardh salah is considered a grave sin).</li>
<li><u>Wajib</u> – Obligatory (missing is considered a sin, just not as great as a fardh salah).</li>
<li><u>Sunnah </u>– Prophet’s Practice. Here there are two types, one Rasulullah prayed regularly known as Muakkadah and one prophet prayed occasionally, Ghair Muakkadah.</li>
<li><u>Nafl </u>– Voluntary.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="rakats">
    <p>This table summarizes the number of rakats for each prayer. These should be memorized so you know how many rakats each you will need to pray. A rakat can be viewed as a single unit or cycle of prayer.</p>

        Preparation Before Salah (checklist):
    </h2>
 <p>  Before beginning to pray one must be in a state of cleanliness. This is done by<a href="https://myislam.org/how-to-do-wudu/"> performing Wudu </a>(ablution). In other cases, Tayammum or Ghusl are also acceptable methods of purification.</p>

<div class="how">
<h2>How to Pray Fardh, Sunnah, and Nafl Salah / Namaz:</h2>
<p>After going through the prerequisites of Salah we are now ready to begin our prayer.</p>
<p>1. Begin with the proper niyyah (intention) that you want to pray, this can be done in your mind or verbally. The purpose is so that you are not heedless in prayer but are aware of the kind of salat you are about to offer.

</p>
<p>I intend to offer the _____ rakats of the ____ prayer. So you could say something along the lines, “I intend to offer the 4 rakats fardh of the Isha prayer” or “2 rakat nafl for zuhr prayer”.</p>
<img src="https://myislam.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Standing-position-in-prayer.jpg">
<p>2. Ensure your praying area is clean, put down you prayer mat facing the direction of the Qiblah. Stand as you would normally with your feet around four inches apart. Direct your gaze towards the place of your sajdah. Now, with palms open, raise your hands to your ears and say the Takbir (Allahu Akbar) which means Allah is the greatest. Your prayer has now commenced. Women praying should raise their hands to their shoulders.

</p>
<img src="https://myislam.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/saying-allahu-akbar-to-start-prayer.jpg">
<P>3. After Takbir, place cross your hands at chest level grabbing your left wrist with your right hand.[3] Begin with the recitation of thana. [4]

</P>
<p>سُبْحانَكَ اللَّهُمَّ وَبِحَمْدِكَ، وَتَبارَكَ اسْمُكَ ،وَتَعَالَى جَدُّكَ، وَلاَ إِلَهَ غَيْرُكَ </p>
<p>Subhaanaka Allaahumma wa bihamdika, wa tabaarakasmuka, wa ta’aalaa jadduka, wa laa ‘ilaaha ghayruka.</p>
<p>Meaning: Glory and praise be to You, O Allah. Blessed be Your name and exalted be Your majesty, there is none worthy of worship except You.</p>
<h3>Recite Tauz or Ta’awwudh and continue with saying bismillah.</h3>
<p>اعوذ باللہ من الشیطان الرجیم</p>
<p>auzu billahi minash shaitan rajeem</p>
<p>Meaning: I seek Allah’s protection from Satan, the accursed.</p>
<p>بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم</p>
<p>bismillah hir rahman nir Raheem</p>
<p>Meaning: In the name of Allah who is kind and merciful.</p>
<img src="https://myislam.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Crossing-hand-for-namaz.jpg">
<p>4. After this recite Surah Al-Fatiha which is the first chapter of the Quran.</p>
<P>اَلْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ رَبِّ الْعٰلَمِیْنَۙ  (۱) الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِیْمِۙ(۲) مٰلِكِ یَوْمِ الدِّیْنِؕ(۳) اِیَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَ اِیَّاكَ نَسْتَعِیْنُؕ(۴) اِهْدِنَا الصِّرَاطَ الْمُسْتَقِیْمَۙ(۵) صِرَاطَ الَّذِیْنَ اَنْعَمْتَ عَلَیْهِمْ غَیْرِ الْمَغْضُوْبِ عَلَیْهِمْ وَ لَا الضَّآلِّیْنَ۠  </P>
<p>Alhamdu lillaahi Rabbil ‘aalameen Ar-Rahmaanir-Raheem Maaliki Yawmid-Deen Iyyaaka na’budu wa lyyaaka nasta’een Ihdinas-Siraatal-Mustaqeem Siraatal-lazeena an’amta ‘alaihim ghayril-maghdoobi ‘alaihim wa lad-daaalleen</p>
<p>Meaning: Praise be to Allah, the Cherisher and Sustainer of the worlds; Most Gracious, Most Merciful; Master of the Day of Judgment. Thee do we worship, and Thine aid we seek. Show us the straight way, The way of those on whom Thou hast bestowed Thy Grace, those whose (portion) is not wrath, and who go not astray.</p>
<p><i>At the end of reciting Surah Fatiha say Ameen.</i></p>
<hr>
<p>5. While praying the first two rakats, after saying ameen, recite any passage from the Qur’an. Surah Ikhlas is commonly taught first because it is one of the shorter surahs and for the great rewards associated with it. [11] For prayers which exceed two rakat, you only need to recite Surah Fatiha and can move onto step 6 without reciting any extra passage after fatiha.</p>
<h3>Surah Ikhlas:</h3>
<p>بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم</p>
<p>قل هوا لله أحد،الله الصمد، لم يلد و لم يولد، و لم يكن له كفوا أحد</p>
<p>Bismillah hir Rahman nir Rahim Qul Huwallahu ahad. Allahussamad. Lam yalid wa lam yu-lad. Wa lam yakun lahu kufuwan ahad.
</p>
<p>Meaning: In the name of Allah, the most Gracious, the most Merciful. Say, He is Allah, the One. Allah is Eternal and Absolute. He begets not, nor was He begotten. And there is none co-equal unto Him.</p>
<hr>
<p>6. Say Allahu Akbar, bend down for ruku. Ruku is the position where you keep your head and back aligned and put your hands on your knees. Here recite Tasbeeh three times or any odd number of times you like.

</p>
<p>سُبْحَانَ رَبِّيَ الْعَظِيمِ</p>
<p>Subhana Rabbiyal Adhim</p>
<p>Meaning: Glory be to my Lord Almighty</p>
<img src="https://myislam.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ruku-or-bowing-position.jpg">
<p>7. Next stand up from the bowing position saying [5],</p>
<p>سَمِعَ اللَّهُ لِمَنْ حَمِدَه</p>
<p>Sami’Allahu liman hamidah</p>
<p>Meaning: Allah hears those who praise Him</p>
<p>رَبَّنَا وَلَكَ الْحَمْد</p>
<p>Rabbana lakal hamd</p>
<p>Meaning: Our lord, to you be the praise.</p>
<p>According to Hambali Fiqh, you can raise both your hands up to your earlobes before entering ruku and after coming up from ruku. While coming up from ruku your hands should be at your side and not crossed at the chest.</p>
<img src="https://myislam.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Standing-position-in-prayer.jpg">
<p>8. Say Allahu Akbar and go down for sajdah (prostration). There should 5 points of contact with the ground, your forehead, nose, palms of hand, knees, and toes of the feet. Put your head between your palms such that your thumbs are aligned with earlobes. The elbows should be raised away from the ground. In this position recite Tasbeeh three or any odd number of times you like.</p>
<p>سُبْحَانَ رَبِّيَ الأَعْلَى</p>
<p>Subhana Rabbiyal A’la</p>
<p>Meaning: How Perfect is my Lord, the Highest</p>
<img src="https://myislam.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Sujud-or-prostration.jpg">
<p>9. Say Allahu Akbar, sit upright. It is sunnah to keep your right foot up and lay the left foot on the ground. [6] This position is called Jalsah Al-istiraha or the sitting position of the prayer. Rest your hands on the thighs with fingers reaching the knees. Recite the following, [7]</p>
<p>رب اغفر لي</p>
<p>Rabbighfir li</p>
<p>Meaning: O my Lord! Forgive me</p>
<p>Say Allahu Akbar and go for your second sujud, recite Subhana Rabbiyal A’la tasbeeh three times. After say Allahu Akbar and stand back up and cross your arms just as before. This represents one complete rakat of salah.</p>
<p>Perform the second rakat the same, except you do not need to recite subhanaka. When you complete the second sujood of the second rakat stay seated in position of Jalsah.</p>
<img src="https://myislam.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Jalsah-al-Istiraha.jpg">
<p>10. Here we recite Tashahhud silently:</p>
<p>
التَّحِيَّاتُ لِلَّهِ وَالصَّلَوَاتُ وَالطَّيِّبَاتُ، السَّلاَمُ عَلَيْكَ أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ وَرَحْمَةُ اللَّهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ، السَّلاَمُ عَلَيْنَا وَعَلَى عِبَادِ اللَّهِ الصَّالِحِينَ، أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ

</p>
<p>Attahiyat lillahi wa salawatu wa’t-tayyibat, as-salamu ‘alayka ayyuha’n-Nabiyyu wa rahmat-Allahi wa barakatuhu. As-salamu ‘alayna wa ‘alaa ‘ibad-Illah is-saliheen. ashhadu alla ilaha illallah wa ashhadu anna muhammadan ‘abduhu wa rasuluhu
</p>
<p>Meaning: All the best compliments and the prayers and the good things are for Allah. Peace and Allah’s Mercy and Blessings be on you, O Prophet! Peace be on us and on the pious slaves of Allah, I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and I also testify that Muhammad is Allah’s slave and His Apostle.

</p>
<p>When you read the shahada (testimony of faith – ashhadu alla ilaha illallah wa ashhadu anna muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluhu) ball up your right hand into a fist and raise your index finger. This symbolizes the tawhid or oneness of Allah. At this point if the salat consists of more than two rakat you would say the takbir, i.e. Allahu akbar and begin the third rakat. If the salah only consists of two rakats then you would continue with the following supplication known as Salawat which is sends blessings and salutations towards the Prophet Muhammad and Prophet Ibrahim, may peace be upon them.

</p>
<p>
ٱللَّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَىٰ مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَلَىٰ آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ كَمَا صَلَّيْتَ عَلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَعَلَىٰ آلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيدٌ ٱللَّٰهُمَّ بَارِكْ عَلَىٰ مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَلَىٰ آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ كَمَا بَارَكْتَ عَلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَعَلَىٰ آلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيدٌ

</p>
<p>Allahumma salli ‘ala Muhammadin Wa ‘ala ali Muhammadin Kama sallaita ‘ala Ibrahima wa ‘ala ali Ibrahima wa barik ‘ala Muhammadin wa ‘ala ali Muhammadin Kama barakta ‘ ala Ibrahima Wa ‘ ala ali Ibrahima Fil a’lamina Innaka hamidun Majid.”
</p>
<p>Meaning: “O Allah, let Your mercy come upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad as You let it come upon Ibrahim and the family of Ibrahim O Allah, bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad as You blessed Ibrahim and the family of Ibrahim. Truly You are Praiseworthy and Glorious.”

</p>
<img src="https://myislam.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/tashahhud.jpg">
<p>11. Turn your face towards looking over your right shoulder and then turn to left. Each time recite the following:</p>
<p>السَّلاَمُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ</p>
<p>Assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullah [8]</p>
<p>Meaning: peace and the mercy of Allah be on you.</p>
<img src="https://myislam.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/tasleem.jpg">
<img src="https://myislam.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/assalamualaikum-warahmatullah-prayer.jpg">
<p>This would complete the two rakah salah. It is recommended to offer dua after salah, especially after fardh salah. [9]</p>
<h3>Dua After Salam:</h3>
<p>
اللَّهُمَّ أَعِنِّي عَلَى ذِكْرِكَ، وَشُكْرِكَ، وَحُسْنِ عِبَادَتِكَ</p>
<p>Allahumma a’innee alaa dhikrika, wa shukrika, wa husni ‘ibaadatika</p>
<p>Meaning: O Allah, help me to remember You and thank You and help me to the best manner of worshipping You. [10]

</p>
<p>A note for the third and fourth rakah prayers (as in Zuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Insha) the process is the repeated as per usual. The only difference is in the third and fourth rakat Surah Fatiha is always read silently. After saying Ameen it’s not necessary to recite any other passage and to go straight into ruku and sajdah.
